- three threads, one checking the time, create one for each new backup command
- backup command should have a lock on the folder
- one thread should just wait for user input

- timer
	- needs to trigger once a day at midnight
	- time is hard
	- reference the infinite undo article "falsehoods programmers believe about time"
	- use cron

- logging
	- log everything
	- syslog

- backup
	- copy the contents of the specified location to a new location
	- use exec
	- how to check for success/failure
	- make sure the backup folder exists before copying to it
	- source and dest should be args
	- do I need to call ls to get the list of files before
	- does it need to be recursive
	- path names have a max length so they can be pre allocated
	- there could be any number of files in a direcrory(unlimited) so count them before allocating memory
	- program should pass arguments to ls to only show files we want
	- free memory
	- use cp
		- use the -u flag to cp to only copy updates and new files
	- to trigger the backup using cron, pgrep for the pid then send the backup signal
		- command: kill -10 $(pgrep backupd)

- changed files
	- how to keep track of changed files

- track changes
	- use auditd to to record edits to the folder
		- command: auditctl -w /var/www/html/dev/ -p w

- lock
